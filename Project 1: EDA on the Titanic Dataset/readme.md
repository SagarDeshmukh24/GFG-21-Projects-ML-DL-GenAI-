# 🚢 End-to-End Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic Dataset

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents a complete **end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the famous **Titanic dataset**, which contains passenger information from the Titanic shipwreck. The goal is to explore the data, clean it, visualize important patterns, and derive meaningful insights related to passenger survival.

EDA helps in understanding the structure of the data, relationships between variables, and key factors that influenced survival on the Titanic.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand the structure and quality of the Titanic dataset  
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Handle missing and inconsistent values  
- Analyze relationships between features and survival  
- Visualize key patterns and trends  
- Extract meaningful insights from data

## 📁 Dataset Description

The Titanic dataset includes passenger details such as:

- `PassengerId` – Unique identifier for each passenger  
- `Survived` – Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)  
- `Pclass` – Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)  
- `Name` – Passenger name  
- `Sex` – Gender  
- `Age` – Age of the passenger  
- `SibSp` – Number of siblings/spouses aboard  
- `Parch` – Number of parents/children aboard  
- `Ticket` – Ticket number  
- `Fare` – Passenger fare  
- `Cabin` – Cabin number  
- `Embarked` – Port of embarkation

## 🔍 EDA Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Understanding
- Dataset shape and structure  
- Data types and summary statistics  

### 2️⃣ Data Cleaning
- Handling missing values  
- Removing or transforming irrelevant columns  
- Data type corrections  

### 3️⃣ Univariate Analysis
- Distribution of individual variables  
- Survival rate analysis  
- Age, gender, and class distributions  

### 4️⃣ Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis
- Survival vs Gender  
- Survival vs Passenger Class  
- Survival vs Age & Fare  
- Correlation analysis  

### 5️⃣ Visualization
- Bar plots  
- Count plots  
- Histograms  
- Box plots  
- Heatmaps

## 📊 Key Insights

- Gender played a significant role in survival chances  
- Passengers in higher classes had better survival rates  
- Younger passengers had relatively higher survival probability  
- Fare and passenger class were strongly correlated with survival
